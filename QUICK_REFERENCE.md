# Quick Reference: Oyster Hardening Protocol

## Recommended Treatment: Fresh Water + Temperature Hardening

### Protocol Details
- **Fresh Water Exposure:** 2 hours, 3 times per week
- **Temperature Hardening:** 6 hours daily at 35°C  
- **Treatment Duration:** Minimum 2 weeks
- **Target Stage:** Juvenile oysters (10K+ seed size)

### Expected Outcomes
- **Heat Stress Survival:** 15.5% vs 12.2% (control) under 42°C stress
- **Normal Conditions:** No difference from control (~73% survival)
- **Cost vs Benefit:** Modest improvement, evaluate against operational costs

### Implementation Checklist

#### Infrastructure Needed
- [ ] Separate treatment tanks with temperature control
- [ ] Fresh water supply (filtered, appropriate quality)
- [ ] Temperature monitoring and control system
- [ ] Timer/scheduling system for treatments

#### Operational Steps
1. **Setup Phase**
   - [ ] Calibrate temperature control systems
   - [ ] Test fresh water quality
   - [ ] Establish treatment schedule

2. **Treatment Phase**
   - [ ] Transfer oysters to treatment tanks
   - [ ] Monitor temperature (maintain 35°C ± 1°C)
   - [ ] Time fresh water exposures (2 hours exactly)
   - [ ] Return oysters to normal culture conditions between treatments

3. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Record treatment parameters daily
   - [ ] Monitor oyster condition/mortality
   - [ ] Maintain detailed treatment logs

### When NOT to Use This Protocol
- Normal, stable culture conditions
- Limited handling/infrastructure capacity
- Cost exceeds expected benefits for operation size
- High baseline mortality from other causes

### Alternative: Fresh Water Only
If temperature control is not feasible:
- **Protocol:** 2 hours fresh water, 3 times weekly
- **Expected benefit:** Moderate improvement over control
- **Lower infrastructure requirements**
